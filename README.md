# molecular-dynamics-simulations
Simulates various types of ensembles such as NVT and NVE

## NVE Simulation
To run the NVE simulation, 
Open the file NVE.py,

- Select type of process `Euler`, `Verlet`, `Periodic Verlet`
- Enter the correct virial coefficients
- At the bottom of the file, enter parameters for simulation
- Use SI units for all quantities
- Outputs will be present in the folder with the same name as the process you selected
